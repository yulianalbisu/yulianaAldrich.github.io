                        It is important the client follow during the process, as I work around the value stream. Will be presenting a lo-fi 
                        prototype with the result of the findings, distribution, graphics, sequence, layouts, to make sure this is the 
                        product we want before making it more detailed
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First closer sketch and how your product will look, the font and sizes, the different screens, the buttons, navigation components,
                        color brand and most likely the details
                    </p>

                    Interactive Prototype
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The fun part! this is the most enjoyable part of the phases. Now that we coordinate everything I will be creating a prototype 
                    that anyone can use and it will have all the features and animations required for the project. Now you have a clear idea of 
                    what is the product and how the user will drive around.
                    <br>
                    This is when I would pull the developer team and user, to conduct usability and improvements before going into the development face.
                    The development face it is important because you give them a chance to look for tools and technologies to best represent this application.
